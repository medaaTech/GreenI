# GreenI

This is the medaa team's solution to the 12th edition of Polihack, held by OSUT.

This is a mobile app that provides a tool that makes recycling way easier, solving the main issue regarding the lack of frequency of recycling in our day to day lives.

## Features

### Reviews

Creates a community by connecting people on a platform similar to social media, where you can add on the map and leave reviews of different recycling centers nearby you.

### Map of the recycling centers

The app includes a map that helps you view all the recycling centers added by users or already present nearby you. 

### Rewards system

The application includes a reward system that stimulates its user to keep on recycling. Every item has a specific number of points that can be viewed after scanning the QR code that the recycling center generates. They are summed up and at certain levels, you can unlock new stickers in the app that you can view.

### Safe signing up

Every user has an account, safely implemented using Google Firebase. The app therefore includes Sign Up, Log in, Log out and Forgot your password pages that allow you to navigate through the application.
